\section{Modeling and Simulations}
\subsection{Modeling}
\subsubsection{Need for Modeling: Difficulties}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Understanding and predicting complex systems behaviour
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Many properties
		\item many input parameters
		\item Various environmental conditions
		\item Different constraints
		\item Diverse outputs
	\end{itemize}
	\item Building real-life systems during design or for testing
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Expensive
		\item Requires personnel
		\item Difficult to modify
		\item Not sure how
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Modeling as a Solution}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Building an abstract representation of the real system
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Reduced complexity
		\item Important characteristics only
		\item Cheaper
		\item Highly modifiable
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Model Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A representation of a system from a certain point of view
		and at a certain level of abstraction
	\begin{itemize}
		\item CPU of a computer
	\end{itemize}
	\item A representation containing the essential features of an
		object or event in the real world
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Airplane, train network, weather system
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Modeling Definition}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Process of building a model
	\item Designing and analyzing a representation of a system to
		study the effect changes to system variables have
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Modeling Benefits}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Allows for investigation of the properties of the system
	\item Enables prediction of future systems behaviour and outputs
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Modeling Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Most models are inherently inexact (due to the
		simplifications and assumptions made)
	\item Accuracy is limited as:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Most parameters and equations used only estimate
			the real world situation
		\item Initial conditions are not known
		\item Environment influence is either ignored or limited
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Simulation Definition}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Process of performing experiments using a model in order
		to determine the outcome
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Analysis Definition}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Processing and interpreting the results of experiments in
		order to draw conclusions
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Studying a System}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Experiments with the actual system
	\item Experiments with a model of the system
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Prototyping
		\item Modeling
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Mathematical modeling
			\item Modeling and Simulation
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Model Types}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Deterministic or Stochastic
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Deterministic: all variables are deterministic
		\item Stochastic: Some model variables or behaviours are
			random
	\end{itemize}
	\item Static or Dynamic:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Static: the model does not change in time
		\item Dynamic the model is modified in time
	\end{itemize}
	\item Continuous or Discrete:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Continuous: the system state evolves continuously
		\item Discrete: the system state changes at discrete points in
		time
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Stages in Modeling - Take A}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Simplification and Abstraction
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A model contains essential characteristics of
			real-life objects or events
		\item This stage identifies relevant features of real
			system to be modeled
		\item Assumptions are made
		\item Input parameters are determined
		\item Output measures are listed
	\end{itemize}
	\item Representation and Measurements
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Object, events, numbers and relationships in the
			real system are associated model components
	\end{itemize}
	\item Manipulation
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Implementation of real world objects and
			relationships are determined
		\item New objects and relationships are represented
	\end{itemize}
	\item Verification
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Outcomes from the model are compared with real
			world outcomes
		\item It is determined if the model is adequate for the
			desired purpose
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Stages in Modeling - Take B}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Determine the goals and objectives
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Level of abstraction
		\item Relevant features to be modelled
		\item Required input and expected output
	\end{itemize}
	\item Build a conceptual model
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Very high level
		\item Determines how comprehensive the model will be
		\item Determines state variables if they are dynamic,
			how important they are etc.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Create the specification model
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Average detailed level
		\item May involve equations, pseudocode, etc.
		\item Indicates input and output
	\end{itemize}
	\item Convert into a computational model
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Low detail level
		\item Involves a general purpose or a simulation
			programming language
		\item It is the actual useful model
	\end{itemize}
	\item Verification and validation
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Verification
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Did we build the model right? According to
				Specification
		\end{itemize}
		\item Validation:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Did we build the right model? Relative to
				the real system
		\end{itemize}
